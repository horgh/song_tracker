Requirements:
 - PHP 5.3+
 - PostgreSQL (recent version?)

Setup:
 1. Create a database and user.

 2. Set $DB_ variables to match the above in src/Database.php

 3. Import schema_postgres.sql to this database.

 4. Place website/ directory in a webserver accesible location.
 5. Visit http://your.website/music/register.php to register.
 6. Begin updating to api.php!

URLs:
 By default, visiting a user page is
 http://your.website/music/index.php?user=username
 With URL rewriting you can have a URL such as
 http://your.website/music/username
 A rule to accomplish this in lighttpd is as follows:
  url.rewrite-once = (
    	"^/music/([a-zA-Z]+)$" => "/music/index.php?user=$1"
  )
 Note: the mod_rewrite module must be loaded.
 A similar rule can be used with other webservers.
